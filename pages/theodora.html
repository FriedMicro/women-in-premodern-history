        <h2>Who Was Theodora?</h2
      </section>
      <p class="content-half">
        Theodora was the wife of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Justinian-I" target="_blank">Justinian</a> and served as the empresses of the <a href="http://www.penfield.edu/webpages/jgiotto/onlinetextbook.cfm?subpage=1679589" target="_blank">Byzantine</a> empire. Many citizens actually felt that she was the one ruling the empire and following her death very little legal material was passed.

        <h2>Past History</h2>
        <img title="Leda and the Swan" src="../images/leda-swan.jpg" class="image-half image-circular" />
        <p class="content-half">
          In her past life she was an actress involved in a very exotic form of theater known as mime which involves a great deal of nudity. Her call to fame was her take on the myth of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leda_and_the_Swan" target="_blank">Leda and the Swam</a> where during her show geese would eat barley that had been
          positioned on her groin. The photo presented here is a painting of the event. In the far background you can see a temple as a reminder that it is Zeus involved. The area is surrounded by vegetation as if to make the whole scene more secluded.

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p class="content-half">
          Using her sway and attractiveness she was able to get <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Justinian-I" target="_blank">Justinian</a> to change the law so that she would be able to marry him. Her influence within the marriage allowed her to do a great number of things such as putting down rebellions such as was the case with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nika_riots" target="_blank">Nika Revolt</a>. She also improved womenâ€™s rights within the empire. Lastly she was a Christian convert. The changes made to Roman law were writen in the Justinian code pictured on the right.
